It is a replication of the Windows XP which is the first almost stable operating system Microsoft created. This project is only develoepd by using only Html, Css, and Java. All rights reserved to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in">Microsoft&reg;</a>

Sharing Experience + Note 4.0: it was the last project of windows operationg system replication. I had fun while creating all the GUI's of Windows. It was challanging at first but it was getting easier as I was doing it. So in this project, I tried to create the whole experience of Windows XP GUI.
